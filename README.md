# Number Systems and Conversions

Written By: Grace Hardester

Conversion of numbers is important when working in the digital world. No matter how old or how young, if you want to work in the digital world, you need to know this information! There are lots of different ways numbers can be converted and they all have their own purpose. For this project, I am going to talk about the three main ones: Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal.  

## Decimal

The decimal system is what we grow up learning as kids. It is also known as the base-10 system, which means it represents any number using 10 digits: 0 through 9. When first learning numbers, we learn about the one's place, ten's place, hundredth's place, and so on. The reason it is called those place holders is because of this: 


| Base-10 | Outcome          |
|---------|------------------|
|   10^0  |   1's place      | 
|   10^1  |   10's place     | 
|   10^2  |   100's place    |  
|   10^3  |   1,000's place  | 
|   10^4  |   10,000's place |

## Binary
The Binary system is known as the base-2 system, and is only composed of 0's and 1's. The reason binary only has two numbers is because it is much easier for a computer to analyze two numbers versus ten. In binary, the zero acts as an "off switch" and the one acts as the "on switch". So, whenever the number one is present in the binary number presented, that number is added to the total, while the zero is not. Just like the decimal chart above, the binary can be written out as a chart as well. 

| Base-2:             | 2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |           |
|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----------|
| Outcome:            | 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |           |
| Example in Binary:  | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | TOTAL: 49 |

In this chart there are lots of things going on:
1. The top row explains the base-2 system. So, instead of using 10 to the something power, we are now using 2. The base-2 system also works the same way as the base-10 system with the smallest number to the farmost right. 
2. The middle row computes the top row and gives you the answer.
3. The bottom row is an example of a binary number. The way you look at this number is 1's being the "on switch" and 0's being the "off switch". So, to compute this you will add up all of the numbers where there is a 1: 1+16+32 for a total of 49. The answer 49 is in decimal form. 

## Hexadecimal
